1. to run redis container without warnings
    on host machnine in '/etc/sysctl.conf' set 
        vm.overcommit_memory=1

    and run with 'privileged' permissions

    i.e we are allowing the container to take as much as memoery required ( regardless of memoery availability ).
        this may lead out-of-memory (OOM) errors if processes attempt to use more memory than is physically available.
        - be carefull


     
2. inspecting
   
   $ docker exec -it redis-loacl /bin/sh

   $ redis-cli             # enter into redis cli

   $ AUTH redis redis      # AUTH username password


3. to get the ip address
   $ docker inspect redis-local | grep IPAddress

   use this ip address to connect from redisinsight


4. connection string
   $ redis://redis:redis@172.17.0.2:6379
   $ redis://user:password@host:port


5. What is 
   user USER_NAME on >USER_PASSWORD ~* &* +@all

      Each part means:

      on - enables the user account
      >USER_PASSWORD - sets the password to "USER_PASSWORD"
      ~* - allows access to all key patterns (~ is for key patterns, * means all keys)
      &* - allows access to all pub/sub channels (& is for channels, * means all channels)
      +@all - grants all available Redis commands (+@ means add command category, all means all commands)


      This is essentially giving superuser/admin privileges to the "redis" user.
      If you want more restricted permissions, you could replace +@all with specific command categories like:

      +@read - only read commands
      +@write - only write commands
      +@admin - only admin commands
