1. Understand Kubernetes Architecture
   - Core Concepts: Pods, Nodes, Clusters, and Namespaces.
   - Components: Kubernetes Master (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager) and Worker Nodes (Kubelet, Kube-proxy).

2. Learn Kubernetes Resources
   - Basic Resources: Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
   - Advanced Resources: StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and Ingress.

3. Hands-on with kubectl
   - Learn to interact with a cluster using kubectl commands.
   - Practice creating, updating, and deleting Kubernetes resources via YAML files.

4. Kubernetes Networking
   - Understand Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
   - Learn about DNS in Kubernetes and networking policies.

5. Storage in Kubernetes
   - Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC).
   - Storage Classes and dynamic provisioning.

6. Container Orchestration Concepts
   - Scaling applications (horizontal and vertical scaling).
   - Rolling updates and rollbacks.
   - Understanding liveness and readiness probes.

7. Explore Helm
  - Learn how to package, deploy, and manage applications using Helm charts.

8. Monitor and Debug Kubernetes
  - Learn to inspect logs (kubectl logs) and debug pods.
  - Understand resource monitoring using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Kubernetes dashboard.

9. Kubernetes Security
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
  - Securing Secrets and managing ServiceAccounts.

10. Setup a Local Environment
  - Use tools like Minikube, Kind, or Docker Desktop with Kubernetes for local practice.

11. Cloud-Native Ecosystem
  - Explore cloud-managed Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS).
  - Learn about CNCF tools that integrate with Kubernetes (e.g., Istio, Linkerd, ArgoCD).
